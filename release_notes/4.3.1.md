# clas12_tags 4.3.1. Deprecated.

- FTOF Time resolution updated based on data
- Option  <a href="https://gemc.jlab.org/gemc/html/documentation/rerunEvents.html">SAVE_SELECTED, RERUN_SELECTED</a> to save RNG state for certain particles, detector
- Option  <a href="https://gemc.jlab.org/gemc/html/documentation/ancestry.html"> SAVE_ALL_ANCESTORS </a> to save complete particles hierarchy in output (evio2root also updated)
- gcards for rg-a different run-periods
- gcards for rg-b different run-periods
- ec, pcal digitization removed obsolete constants
- moved ftof shield in the correct position
- Option written in JSON format
- rga_fall2018 variations for: FTOF, EC, PCAL, CTOF geometry services
- default variation for DC geometry service
- ltcc variarions for different run periods
- added Geometry variation as a gcard option: DIGITIZATION_VARIATION, to be used by digitization routines.
