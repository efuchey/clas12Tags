# clas12_tags 5.4

- RF Frequency > RF Period 
- read RF parameters from DB if RFSETUP is set to `clas12_ccdb`
- RICH digitization (Connor Pecar, partially completed)
- updated RICH geometry

Standardized fadc time and tdc as follows:

```
	int fadc_time = convert_to_precision(time_in_ns);
	int tdc = time_in_ns/a1;
```

where
```
	double fadc_precision = 0.0625;  // 62 picoseconds resolution
	int convert_to_precision(double tdc) {
		return (int( tdc / fadc_precision ) / fadc_precision);
	}
```

1. time to tdc constants from CCDB 
2. verify time_to_tdc used in LUND background when applicable
2. fadc_time comes from convert_to_precision (time_in_ns)

- the following options are added/updated in the gcard:

  - SAVE_ALL_MOTHERS=1
  - SKIPREJECTEDHITS=1

 The following additional option to enable truth matching is 
 commented out and added on the OSG portal.
  - INTEGRATEDRAW=“*”


These changes do not affect the single electrons events memory usage (stays about ~1.0g) 
and increase the corresponding running time for 2000 events on ifarm,
from 437 seconds (4.58Hz) to  581 seconds (3.44Hz), or 25%, 
due to looping over all tracks for each event.
